## Classy weather

Search for city names to get the predicted weather for the entire week.
The main goal of this project is to implement the way of writing react.js , which is by using "***class-based components***". The performance was not a priority during development , it was just to LEARN.

! seraching for cities is not the best using the current API !

```bash
git clone [URL]
cd [path of the project]
npm i #To install the necessary modules
npm start
```

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
